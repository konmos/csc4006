The life of a philosopher consists of an alternation of thinking and eating.

Five philosophers, numbered from 0 through 4 are living in a house where the table laid for them, 
each philosopher having his own place at the table.

Their only problem - besides those of philosophy - is that the dish served is a very 
difficult kind of spaghetti, that has to be eaten with two forks. 
There are two forks next to each plate, so that presents no difficulty: 
as a consequence, however, no two neighbours may be eating simultaneously.
