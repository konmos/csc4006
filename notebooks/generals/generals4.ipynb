    "### Extracted Story\n",
    "Several divisions of the Byzantine army are camped outside an enemy city, each division commanded by its own general. Each general observes the enemy and communicates his observation to the others. Each general then combines all the reported observations into a single plan of action (i.e., “attack” or “retreat”), for example, by using a majority vote. Communicating only by messengers, the generals must agree upon a common, and reasonable battle plan, however, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. All loyal generals must carry out the same plan, whereas the traitors may do anything they wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracted Story (verbatim)\n",
    "We imagine that several divisions of the Byzantine army are camped outside an enemy city, each division commanded by its own general. The generals can communicate with one another only by messenger. After observing the enemy, they must decide upon a common plan of action. However, some of the generals may be traitors, trying to prevent the loyal generals from reaching agreement.\n",
    "...\n",
    "All loyal generals decide upon the same plan of action... but the traitors may do anything they wish.\n",
    "...\n",
    "They loyal generals should not only reach agreement, but should agree upon a reasonable plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Everything below this point is based on the verbatim version of the story.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Stories\n",
    "* As a GENERAL I want to...\n",
    "  * make observations on an enemy city to decide upon a plan of action.\n",
    "  * be able to communicate with other genrals to share our observations.\n",
    "* As a LOYAL GENERAL I want to...\n",
    "  * decide upon a reasonable plan of action so that my division does what is best.\n",
    "  * decide upon the same plan of action as all other loyal generals so order within the army is maintained.\n",
    "* As a DISLOYAL GENERAL I want to...\n",
    "  * make false or contradicting observations to prevent the loyal generals from reaching agreement.\n",
    "* As a MESSENGER I want to...\n",
    "  * deliver messages between generals/divisons so they can reach upon some agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traitors always return RETREAT.\n",
    "* The code is modelled to be thematically accurate, thus;\n",
    "    * Each general has \"his own\" messenger.\n",
    "    * When a general \"speaks\", he dispatches jobs to his messenger who delivers them to the other generals.\n",
    "    * When a general \"listens\", he adds what he heard to his list of observations and dispatches his messenger to propagate the message.\n",
    "    * The commander kick-starts the cycle.\n",
    "* The recursive algorithm is replaced by threads executing jobs placed on a queue.\n",
    "    * This makes it difficult to know when we're finished - a timeout of 2 seconds is used here.\n",
    "* There is no sophisticated integrity/authenticity checking of any kind, nor does this code verify the claims made in the BGP paper. It is merely a proof of concept for demonstration purposes."
