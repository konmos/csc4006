# Story and Software

This is the repo for my final year project "Story and Software" (CSC4006).

* `./notebooks/` contains all worked examples - BGP, DP, HG, Winograd and Flores, Pierson v. Post, "baby shoes for sale"
* `./docs/` contains markdown documents that were written over the course of the module, a summary of all meetings, images, software report, and final research article
* `./analyse/` contains the narrative analysis code
* `./formalisation/` contains the story-thinking framework, examples, and a developer guide

All work in this repo was created by me (Konrad Mosoczy, QUB) unless indicated otherwise.
