Meeting Summary:

* Technical progress summary.
* Discussion about reports.
* Focus should be on research report.

Potential Technical/Related Work:

* Think about how to implement JVerewolf's code in my framework
  * Potentially implement it. This may require re-writing parts of the code. Be wary of re-writing it such that I effectively end up with my own code.
  * Compare visualizations.
* **README user guides.**
* Perhaps try to find another example online that already lends itself nicely to event-based programming and implement it using the framework. Good to mention in the research report.

Research Report:

* Expand on the preliminary report.
* Extend the literature review.
* Create a "method" section.
* Section for each story.
* Section for formalisation framework.
  * Also, a section for the demonstration of the framework.
* Section for narrative analysis.
* Discussion section.
* Try to avoid writing a "diary" - focus on issues solved, not on things done.

Software Report:

* More technical complement to the research report.
* See handbook on canvas.
