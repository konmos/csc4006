* Research report first draft complete. Some further work is as follows:
  * Restructuring sections.
  * Stating research objectives.
  * Specific contributions.
  * Think about the location/existence of the "Narrative Analysis" section.
  * Expand last two sections.
  * Separate demonstrations into own section.
  * Write a structured abstract - background, objective, findings, conclusion.
    * This will also make clear what other changes to make in the paper.
  * Overall, good draft which just needs "focusing".
* Now, 2 weeks for software report, and a final 2 weeks for polishing and rewriting things. Then the presentation.
