This meeting was mostly spent discussing the project roadmap over the next few months.

# Basic Roadmap Overview

1. Aim to finish technical work around 7-14th March. This may be revisited at a later time (for example, during the Easter Holidays).
   1. Threading.
   2. Live stepping through events.
   3. Basic CLI.
   4. Cleanup and polish.
2. Once technical work is finished, focus on research and software reports (14th March onwards).
   1. May need to do more literature review.
   2. Must allocate enough time for this to make sure I do justice to the work I have accomplished.
