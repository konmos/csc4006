* Two approaches to the Python framework/library:
  * A comprehensive framework for interfacing with actual code (ideally the added complexity would provide *some* benefits beyond just visualization).
  * A declarative language which describes the "flow" of a story (or software implementation) in terms of actions, events, and agents. A program would then visualize this.
* It is useful to attempt both approaches and then discuss in the report why (if) they don't work.
