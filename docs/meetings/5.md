## Notes

* generals.md...
  * Iterative process of re-reading the paper and finding the story with a new understanding.
  * Go through the paper and highlight all pieces of text which add to the story.
    * Extract into document (as a table?)
* User stories...
  * "Share observatins" - is this inferred?
    * Sometimes the paper talks about observations, sometimes about decisions.
  * "decision... what is best" - inferred
    * We don't know the motivation of the generals.
* Change "Disloyal" to "Traitor"
* Arer the generals sending decisions or observations?
* Include class diagrams in document.
* "Implementation and Assumptions" should maybe be "Experimentation and Assumptions"
* Refine and expand generals.md.
