## Notes

* "parable algorithms"... Might be worth searching on Google.
* Look at the previously linked Github solution to the BGP and compare with my code/experiments.
* Refine preliminary article.
* Think about the Dining Philosophers.
* Consider in depth the direction of the project.
* Write a separate version of the appendix from the preliminary report without cutting detail.
  * This may become the software report in the future!
