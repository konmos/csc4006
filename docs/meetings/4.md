## Notes

* Referring to the "Code is not Literature" blog... Is it a fair comparison?
* Document which aspects of the engineering was I using in the original extracted story.
* Verbatim vs. non-verbatim... Should we have two separate verions?
* Think about visualising the communications network between the generals.
* Explore sets vs. lists (and any other implementation choices)... Note how different decisions lead to subtle behaviour changes.
* Mention `EnemyCity` in design decisions.
  * Singleton.
  * Although useless, it is a "good" class to have because it is a more faithful representation of the story.
